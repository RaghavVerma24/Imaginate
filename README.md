Imaginate
========================

This project is an AI image generation application that uses OpenAI's DALL-E API to generate images based on user input. The frontend is built with React and Tailwind CSS, and the backend is built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The images generated by DALL-E are stored in Cloudinary.

Technologies Used
-----------------

- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Cloudinary: A cloud-based platform for storing and managing media files.
- DALL-E: OpenAI's API for generating images based on textual descriptions.
- MongoDB: A popular NoSQL database for storing and managing data.
- Express.js: A minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- Tailwind CSS: A highly customizable CSS framework for building modern user interfaces.
